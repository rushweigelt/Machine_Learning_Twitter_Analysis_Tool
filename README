TAT -- Twitter Analysis Tool

The Twitter Analysis Tool was created to solve a complex problem -- how can we better prepare for propoganda bots infiltrating our national election discourse?

Obviously, the federal government isn't acting as the election draws near, and citizens deserve transparent information about who they're interacting with on social media.

Our differentiating factor is that we analyze twitter by hashtag, rather than profile, to capture large-scale bot activity. 

We traind our ml networks on millions of tweets, labelled by Twitter themselves from studies done in the aftermath of the 2016 Election.

The data from tweets containing a user-specified hashtag is scraped, fed into our model, and then a list of suspected tweets from bots is displayed at the bottom of the page.

The app was built as a webapp, in the django-react framework. The front end is ugly--I am a backend developer by nature. 

While we are currently looking into hosting options, the project isn't deployable in anything but a local developer enviornment at the moment.
