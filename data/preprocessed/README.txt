Intended Order
1) Count URLs and/or Hashtags (if the data doesn't have a numeric value, but rather a list, for this data).
2) Standardize Field Names
3) Combine and Label

Must use appropriate folders:
1) Count URLs/Hashtags: data > preprocessed > count
2) Standardize Field Names: data > preprocessed > standardizeFieldnames
3) Combine and Label: data > preprocessed > combineAndLabel
